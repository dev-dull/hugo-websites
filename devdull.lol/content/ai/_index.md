## AI and my job application process:
Hello! This document exists for transparency around how I use AI in my job application process. If you would like to see how Gemini may have influenced how I have written my cover letter or adjusted my resume, please see [this link to a list of recently completed workflow runs](https://github.com/dev-dull/job-search-automations/actions) and click the recent runs that contain the name of your company and the date that matches the one in the filename of the resume I applied with. You can find a short description of my exact process under the section titled, "[My end-to-end RaC workflow](https://devdull.lol/posts/2025.03-devops_your_job_hunt/#my-end-to-end-rac-workflow)" in my post, "[DevOps Your Job Hunt with GitHub Actions and the Google Gemini API For Fast-Feedback](https://devdull.lol/posts/2025.03-devops_your_job_hunt/#my-end-to-end-rac-workflow)".

In the course of applying to the position, I may have also used one or more of the following AI tools:
- GitHub Copilot
- Perplexity.ai

## My general approach to the use of AI
I generally take two, largely similar approaches to my use of AI. The first, which is already familiar to most, is that I see it as another tool in a toolbox akin to a Google search or reading through responses on StackOverflow. My second approach is to treat it like the person who _purports_ themselves as _THE_ expert in the room who is often right, but just as often wrong. I find this second approach helps me treat AI as a, "rubber duck" to help me identify silly mistakes I can't quite spot (e.g. "Do you see a syntax error on line 9?") or to generate an example data structure I don't readily have handy (e.g. "Generate an `IngressRoute` configuration for the service `foo` on port `8080` in the namespace `bar`). Additionally, I lean on AI to help me with the tasks I know I'm bad at (such as abbreviating my résumé as I frequently fail to consider that more information isn't always better), and tasks that I'm new to (such as learning the equivalent pattern to subclassing in Golang).
